# backend/ai_agents/scrapers/spiders/__init__.py

# This file makes 'spiders' a Python sub-package of 'scrapers'.
# This is where all your Scrapy spiders will reside.
# You might import all spiders here to make them discoverable if needed, e.g.:
# from .peertube_spider import PeertubeSpider
# from .another_platform_spider import AnotherPlatformSpider
